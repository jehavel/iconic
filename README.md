# iconic

Currently gathering research for web3.0 framework for developing modularized, scalable socio-economic blocks capable of bridging the gap to transhuman society. That is, the intent is to implement successful, standardized interfaces for social nets/markets from micro to macro, in such a way that web users are incentivized to become content producers as opposed to mere consumers. 

#iconic concepts
  A modern web structure should have at minimum certain built-in qualities that make user control of:
    
    *technical
    *secureable
    *social
    *economic and 
    *political
    
  contexts accessible and rewarding. These are not ideals that data scientists or political engineers are required to understand
  in order to survive the hunting fields of modernity; rather, **each and every individual entity** that participates in the
  economy **must** be equipped with minimal tools and skills to provide meaningful input, lest we all shall stagnate or worse.
  
  #iconic intends to define a core structure for providing these tools, and rewarding these skills. We shall approach the problem
  under the assumption that native support for all of the qualities requisite can be implemented with careful attention to key
  paradigms:
  
    *transparent designs
    *real penalties for data neligence, including developing or distributing flawed wares
    *distributed architectures
    *reputation-based economies
    *user-validated privacy modes
    *unrestricted (and used) access to the opaque data economies
  
  #technical
  Core web techs should not just espouse buzzwords. They should implement the same tested and proven improvements made in
  physical economic modes, for our data culture. Do you really need to save those few instructions by implementing your
  flashy new data object, or is it entirely likely that you could achieve so much more simply by designing an interface for
  data objects (including hardwares)that likely spend most of their lives completely and utterly **latent**
  #iconic does not imply that every potentially beneficial structure is available to your app today; what #iconic does conclude,
  is that the no one entity or even culture today has a toolbox big enough to organize all the different types of cross-tip
  screws we insist on making out of these wonderful modules. 
  **Modular design didn't put Model-T on the road. The maturation into replaceable parts did.**
  
  Thus, #iconic refuses to build 'modular components. #iconic designs marketing schemes to establish standard interfaces that
  demonstrate potential to leverage latent resources in a predictable, history-as-a-test fashion.
